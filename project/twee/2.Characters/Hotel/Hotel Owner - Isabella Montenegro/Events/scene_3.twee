        You notice that she has a dog with her. You've never seen her with a dog before. You wonder what the dog's name is.

        I see you're back from your walk with your dog. What's his name?

    <<say "Isabella" "Isabella">>
        His name is Maxim. I've had him for a few years now. He's a great companion.

    <<say "Player" "$playername">>
        *Maxim... I think I will need to remember that.*

    <<say "Player" "$playername">>
        That's a nice name. Is he a good dog to have around?
    <</say>>

    <<say "Isabella" "Isabella">>
        Yes, he's very friendly and well-behaved. He's great with people and other dogs. I take him for walks every day. It's good exercise for both of us.

    <<say "Player" "$playername">>
        *I should ask her about her training is going.*
