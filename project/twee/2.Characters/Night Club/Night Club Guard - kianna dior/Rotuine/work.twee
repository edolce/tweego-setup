        Oh, I couldn't possibly say. I've seen a lot of things.

        Come on, I won't tell anyone.

        Well, there was this one time a guy came in with a monkey.

    <<say "Player" "$player_name">>
        A monkey?
    <</say>>

    <<say "ivy" "ivy">>
        Yeah, a monkey. He was a regular for a while, but then he stopped coming in.
    <</say>>

    <<say "Player" "$player_name">>
        What happened to the monkey?
    <</say>>

    <<say "ivy" "ivy">>
        I don't know. I never saw him again.

    <<say "Player" "$player_name">>
        That's a shame.

        Sometimes I also work as a stripper at the club, but I prefer bartending.

        Really?

    <<say "ivy" "ivy">>
        Yeah, really. I like the attention, but I don't like the touching.

        I can understand that.
