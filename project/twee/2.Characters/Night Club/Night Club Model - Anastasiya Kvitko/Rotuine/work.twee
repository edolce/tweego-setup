        Well, there was this one time a guy came in with a monkey.

    <<say "Player" "$player_name">>
        A monkey?
    <</say>>

    <<say "kim" "kim">>
        Yeah, a monkey. He was a regular for a while, but then he stopped coming in.
    <</say>>

    <<say "Player" "$player_name">>
        What happened to the monkey?
    <</say>>

    <<say "kim" "kim">>
        I don't know. I never saw him again.
